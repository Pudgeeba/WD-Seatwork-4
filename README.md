## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
 This Website's Theme is inspired by my small jewelry business. This is to showcase creativity through different HTML and CSS skills that has been applied to 2 different features display designs and a landing page. Each Features Display will contain a different style such as featuring a product, an event, and perhaps it can even feature a celebrity!
Throughout this whole project, I was able to come up and play with different designs and styles that is very appealing to the eye. This project also led me to another purpose which is being able to use it for commision purposes!

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use WD- in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use index.html as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only External CSS.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```

|   |   └─ style.css
